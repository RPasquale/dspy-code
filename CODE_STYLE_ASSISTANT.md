# üöÄ DSPy Agent: Code Coding Assistant

## Overview

The DSPy Agent has been enhanced to function as a **Code-style coding assistant** that can successfully build and test software. It combines the power of DSPy's learning capabilities with practical development tools to create a productive coding partner.

## Key Features

### üõ†Ô∏è Enhanced Coding Commands

The agent now includes powerful coding commands that auto-detect your project's build system and tools:

#### Build System Auto-Detection
- **Python**: `uv build`, `python -m build` (setuptools)
- **Node.js**: `npm run build`, `yarn build`
- **Rust**: `cargo build`
- **Go**: `go build`
- **Make**: `make`
- **CMake**: `cmake --build .`

#### Test Framework Auto-Detection
- **Python**: `pytest`, `uv run pytest` (with coverage support)
- **Node.js**: `npm test`, `yarn test` (with coverage)
- **Rust**: `cargo test`
- **Go**: `go test` (with coverage)
- **Make**: `make test`

#### Linter Auto-Detection
- **Python**: Ruff, Black (with auto-fix)
- **Node.js**: ESLint, Prettier (with auto-fix)
- **Rust**: Clippy
- **Go**: go vet, gofmt

### ü§ñ Learning & Feedback System

The agent learns from your coding patterns and provides real-time feedback:

- **`learn <TASK>`**: Record successful coding patterns for future reference
- **`feedback <SCORE>`**: Provide feedback on the agent's performance (0-10 scale)
- **Real-time learning**: The agent continuously improves based on your interactions

### üìä Enhanced Help System

When in coding mode, the help system shows organized commands by category:

- üìÅ **Workspace & Navigation**
- üîç **Code Analysis & Search**
- üõ†Ô∏è **Coding & Development**
- üìä **Planning & Context**
- ü§ñ **Agent & Learning**
- üìù **Git & Version Control**
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration**

## Usage

### Start the Enhanced Coding Assistant

```bash
# Start with coding mode enabled
uv run dspy-agent --coding-mode

# Or start regular mode and enable coding mode later
uv run dspy-agent
dspy-coder> coding-mode on
```

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Build your project
dspy-coder> build

# 2. Run tests with coverage
dspy-coder> test --coverage

# 3. Run linter with auto-fix
dspy-coder> lint --fix

# 4. Learn from successful patterns
dspy-coder> learn "successful Python project setup with uv and pytest"

# 5. Provide feedback
dspy-coder> feedback 9

# 6. Execute custom commands
dspy-coder> run "git status"
```

## Real-Time Learning Integration

The agent integrates with the existing streaming and learning infrastructure:

- **RedDB Integration**: All learning patterns and feedback are stored in RedDB
- **Action Recording**: Every coding action is recorded for RL training
- **Reward Shaping**: Feedback scores are used to improve future coding decisions
- **Streaming Pipeline**: Learning data flows through the universal data streaming system

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced CLI Commands

The following new commands have been added to the interactive session:

- `build [--clean]`: Auto-detect and run build system
- `test [--coverage]`: Auto-detect and run test framework
- `lint [--fix]`: Auto-detect and run linter
- `run <COMMAND>`: Execute shell commands safely
- `learn <TASK>`: Record successful coding patterns
- `feedback <SCORE>`: Provide performance feedback
- `coding-mode on|off`: Toggle enhanced coding mode

### Auto-Detection Logic

The agent intelligently detects your project's toolchain by checking for:

1. **Build files**: `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`
2. **Test frameworks**: Test scripts in `package.json`, `pytest.ini`, test files
3. **Linters**: Dependencies in `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, or built-in tools

### Learning Integration

- **Action Records**: All coding actions are stored as `ActionRecord` in RedDB
- **Reward System**: Feedback scores (0-10) are normalized to rewards (0-1)
- **Pattern Learning**: Successful coding patterns are recorded for future reference
- **RL Training**: The agent uses this data to improve its coding decisions

## Benefits

### For Developers

1. **Unified Interface**: One command to build, test, and lint any project
2. **Auto-Detection**: No need to remember different build commands
3. **Learning Partner**: The agent learns from your coding patterns
4. **Real-Time Feedback**: Provide feedback to improve the agent's performance
5. **Production Ready**: Integrates with existing CI/CD and deployment pipelines

### For Teams

1. **Consistent Workflows**: Standardized build/test/lint commands across projects
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Learning patterns are shared across team members
3. **Quality Assurance**: Integrated testing and linting with coverage
4. **Continuous Improvement**: The agent gets better with each interaction

## Integration with Existing Systems

The enhanced coding assistant seamlessly integrates with:

- **Universal Data Streaming**: Learning data flows through Kafka/Spark
- **RedDB**: All learning patterns and feedback are persisted
- **RL Training**: Coding actions contribute to reinforcement learning
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track agent performance and learning progress
- **Docker Stack**: Works with the existing lightweight deployment

## Future Enhancements

The system is designed to be extensible:

- **Custom Build Scripts**: Add support for custom build systems
- **IDE Integration**: Connect with VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Direct integration with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.
- **Team Learning**: Share learning patterns across team members
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed insights into coding patterns and performance

## Getting Started

1. **Install the agent**: `uv run dspy-agent --coding-mode`
2. **Navigate to your project**: `cd <your-project>`
3. **Start coding**: Use `build`, `test`, `lint` commands
4. **Provide feedback**: Use `learn` and `feedback` commands
5. **Watch it improve**: The agent learns from every interaction

The DSPy Agent is now a powerful Claude Code-style assistant that can successfully build and test software while continuously learning and improving from your feedback!
