# DSPy Agent Coding Training Guide

## 🎯 **The Goal: Shape the Agent into a Productive Coding Partner**

You want the agent to become a **skilled developer** that can:
- ✅ **Build features** that actually work
- ✅ **Fix bugs** effectively  
- ✅ **Write quality code** following best practices
- ✅ **Contribute meaningfully** to your codebase
- ✅ **Make architectural decisions** and solve complex problems

## 🔍 **Verifiers vs Rewards: The Key Distinction**

### **Verifiers** = **Technical Quality Assessors**
- **What**: Measure specific, objective quality metrics
- **Examples**: Test pass rate, code coverage, patch safety, performance
- **Output**: Scores (0.0 to 1.0) for technical aspects
- **Purpose**: Ensure the code actually works and meets technical standards

### **Rewards** = **Behavioral Learning Signals**  
- **What**: Guide the agent's learning and decision-making
- **Examples**: Coding practices, problem-solving approach, collaboration
- **Output**: Reward values that shape the agent's policy
- **Purpose**: Train the agent to be a good coding partner

### **How They Work Together**:
```
Agent Action → Verifiers (Technical) → Rewards (Behavioral) → RL Learning
     ↓              ↓                        ↓                    ↓
   Execute      Assess Quality          Shape Behavior        Update Policy
   Action       (pass_rate, etc.)       (coding practices)    (get smarter)
```

## 🚀 **Training System Overview**

I've created a comprehensive training system that combines both:

### **1. Technical Assessment (Verifiers)**
- **Pass Rate**: Do tests pass?
- **Blast Radius**: Are code changes minimal and focused?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured and documented?

### **2. Behavioral Guidance (Reward Shaping)**
- **Code Quality**: Clean code, error handling, documentation, testing
- **Functionality**: Complete features, bug-free code, good performance
- **Problem Solving**: Understanding, planning, implementation, verification
- **Collaboration**: Communication, explanation, suggestions, learning

### **3. Combined Learning**
- **70% Behavioral** + **30% Technical** = **Comprehensive Training**
- Agent learns both **what works** (verifiers) and **how to be productive** (rewards)

## 🛠️ **How to Use the Training System**

### **Step 1: Set Up Reward Shaping**
```bash
# Set up the reward shaping configuration
uv run python scripts/setup_coding_rewards.py --setup

# View the reward structure
uv run python scripts/setup_coding_rewards.py --show

# Test reward calculation
uv run python scripts/setup_coding_rewards.py --test
```

### **Step 2: Run Training Sessions**
```bash
# Train the agent on realistic coding tasks
uv run python scripts/train_productive_agent.py --tasks 3

# Train on specific difficulty
uv run python scripts/train_productive_agent.py --tasks 2 --difficulty medium
```

### **Step 3: Monitor Learning Progress**
```bash
# Monitor learning in real-time
uv run python scripts/monitor_rl_learning.py --monitor

# Check current learning status
uv run python scripts/monitor_rl_learning.py

# View detailed learning analysis
uv run python scripts/test_rl_learning.py --analysis
```

## 📊 **Training Tasks Available**
